# Arithmetic_Compiler

This is a small project made in java for performing arithmetic operations with the help of file and some codes.

Here I used numbers from 31-40 for coding the operations I need to perform.

31 - Assign
32 - Addition
33 - Substraction
34- Multiplication
35 - Division
36 - print
37 - a
38 - b
39 - c
40 - d

Now,
User will give input using these numbers as an operations like assignment, addition division etc.

If I give like  31 38 54 it means assign 54 to b
If I give like  32 38 39 it means add b and c and assign it to first variable i.e. b

and If I give like 36 38 then it means print b.

User can give any number of input and see the result using these 31-40 instructions.
